# Breast Cancer Detection Application

This project is a breast cancer detection application built using Streamlit and a simple deep learning model. The application allows users to upload data, preprocess it, train a model, and make predictions about whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer based on their medical data.

## Features

- Load and preprocess a dataset of breast cancer patients.
- Train a deep learning model to predict breast cancer outcomes.
- User-friendly interface for selecting patient IDs and making predictions.
- Visualization of feature distributions and predicted probabilities.

## Requirements

To run this application, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `plotly`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy streamlit scikit-learn tensorflow plotly
